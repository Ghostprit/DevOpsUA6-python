Eurofighter Typhoon is a highly agile Air Superiority and
Air-to-Surface, multi-role/swing-role weapon system.
In full operation with six nations – Germany, Italy, Spain, the
United Kingdom, Austria and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia –
Eurofighter Typhoon is the most capable modern combat
aircraft available on the global market. Austria became the
first export customer in 2003. Deliveries to the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia started in 2009. A new contract with the
Sultanate of Oman as the third export customer was signed
in December 2012.
The collective military requirements of the four Partner
Nations are the foundation of the Eurofighter Typhoon
weapon system. This provides a comprehensive and flexible
capability that will meet the demands of many nations over
the next half century. Each aspect of the Eurofighter
Typhoon is designed to provide a balanced contribution to
the overall effectiveness of the weapon system:
• Passive sensors, low radar signature, and supercruise
capability for low detectability
• Integrated sensors and data fusion, for pilot situation
awareness and low cockpit workload
• High supersonic performance for superior Beyond
Visual Range (BVR) combat capability
• Carefree agility, Advanced Short-Range Air-to-Air
Missile (ASRAAM and IRIS-T) and Helmet Mounted
Display (HMD) for excellent Within Visual Range (WVR)
combat capability
• Dedicated radar and FLIR modes for air space policing
• Extensive weapons/stores inventory which includes
effective long and short-range weapons for successful
Air-to-Surface operations
• Automated and mission-tailored defensive aids for high
survivability
• Designed for growth
• Low cost of ownership
